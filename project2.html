                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>This project consisted with the building and training of an AI to detect different types of materials to recycle using a Raspberry Pi, we also needed to build a web using WordPress and a webserver.</p>
                <p>This project was very challenging because the training of and AI is tougher than you might imagine, and we also needed the web to be visible using a DNS. At that time, we didn’t know how to use GitHub to public a WordPress website, so we used Duck DNS.</p>
                <p>We managed our time with "sprint" which were 3 weeks phases in which the first days would talk about what would we do during that 3 weeks and who would do it, this was a very good way to manage our time and our workloads, we used proofhub to manage it online.</p>
                <p>This was a very challenging project but a very fun one and a rewarding experience!</p>

                <h2>Technologies Used</h2>
                <ul class="technologies-list">
                    <h4>Raspberry Pi</h4>
                    <p>We used a Raspberry Pi to store all the needed code for the AI and to also train it, we also had a Raspberry Pi camera connected directly to it to pave the way for the AI to detect the needed materials to recycle.</p>
                    <h4>Duck DNS</h4>
                    <p>We used Duck DNS, which gave us a public DNS domain (https://example.duckdns.org) in which we could store our website developed with WordPress.</p>
                    <h4>WordPress</h4>
                    <p>We build the web using WordPress, and it’s very useful plugins (example: kubio).</p>
                    <h4>AI</h4>
                    <p>We used a Google AI, and we trained it from scratch to detect different recycling materials, those being the main ones like plastic, glass, and paper.</p>
