                <h2>About the Project</h2>
                <p>In this project we managed to create an IT company from scratch, the objective of this IT company was to sell and buy PC components and upgrade them if possible, we managed to create a webserver using HTML, CSS and JS which had all the information of the company.</p>
                <p>We build the webserver using LAMP and UbuntuServer 22.04, and we achieved connection in LAN using a private IP (for example https://192.168.1.1).</p>
                <p>We managed our time with "sprint" which were 3 weeks phases in which the first days would talk about what would we do during that 3 weeks and who would do it, this was a very good way to manage our time and our workloads, we used proofhub to manage it online.</p>
                <p>This was a simple yet good project!</p>

                    <h4>ProofHub</h4>
                    <p>We worked with "sprints" and to manage them we used an online tool called "proofhub‚Äù, with this tool we could create task and assign people to do the task and add it a tittle and a description, when one of the guys who had the task designated, finished the task, he could mark it as done and then a teacher could review it and mark it.</p>
                    <h4>LAMP</h4>
                    <p>With LAMP technologies, we were able to build the webserver with little to no problems and managed to pull the web through and present it.</p>
                    <h4>HTML, CSS, JS</h4>
                    <p>We used these languages to build our web</p>
